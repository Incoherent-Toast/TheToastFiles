This book focuses on listing #
all the foes you may find at #
each location.               #
 One thing to note is that I #
don't list every tag. Each   #
foe has 2 tags for their name#
which I don't list and each  #
elemental foe will have a tag#
for their element i.e. "ice" #
Tags such as "unpushable" are#
listed under immunities but  #
most other immunities have   #
the format of "immune_to_X"  #
and immunity to unmaking is  #
actually tied with the boss  #
tag and doesn't exist as its #
own tag.                     #
                             #

                             #
I've provided a hint box for #
bosses and other some other  #
foes to provide useful info  #
about fighting them but I    #
encourge you to first try and#
find your own strategies.    #
                             #
I've also included some other#
characters and areas of      #
interest in the late sections#
of this book.                #
As many of the these entries #
don't yet exist in game they #
will be based on either      #
in-game references or sourced#
from discord based on what   #
Standard Combo has said but  #
this info might be subject to#
change when they eventually  #
do appear in game.           #

of the decline for Acropolis.#

 Once a squire to Leuce's    #
 personal guard, Fael became #
 disillusioned after their   #
 leader's devolution. Unable #
 to navigate the quickly     #
 shifting political reality, #
 Fael left the city, taking  #
 only a sharp blade and a    #
 poison talisman - a daily   #
 reminder of the loss caused #
 by Bolesh's betrayal.       #

Leuce founded Acropolis which#
served as the capital of the #
dark world. When the Giant   #
Pallas began to threaten her #
domain she split her Soul    #
Stone and used one half to   #
empower a spider which became#
known as "Bolesh". Her plan  #
was successful at defeating  #
Pallas but she lost the ki   #
stone when Bolesh refused to #
give it up and retreated.    #
Without the other half she   #
devolved into a white tree   #
and her impurities dripped   #
down and formed "Xyloalgia". #
Acropolis was now in decline #
and some acropolites became  #
disillusioned with the crumbl#
-ing political order.        #

'———————————————————————————'#
                             #
Raudr was a legendary half - #
stone folk who bore the Frost#
Torch for the guild by that  #
same name.                   #
The Frost Torch guild rose to#
prominance after the fall of #
Pallas filling the power     #
vaccum in its wake.          #
                             #
Hrímnir served under Raudr   #
and was loyal to him but he  #
was eventually trapped in a  #
permafrost prison by The     #
Council of Five.             #
                             #

                             #
The Frost Torch Guild also   #
expanded its domain into the #
bronze mines and constructed #
the Bronze Guardian to secure#
                             #
its position but this back-  #
fired when the Guardian then #
gained sentience and asserted#
its own rule over the mines. #
                             #
The Frost Torch Guild was    #
rapidly collapsing under its #
own bureaucratic weight and  #
Raudr then fled to the under-#
world where he has remained  #
in exile since.              #

   │ The Council of Five │   #
   '—————————————————————'   #
                             #
The Council of Five was a    #
group consisting of 5 members#
each of which served as an   #
"emissary" to their respectiv#
elements, of which we so far #
only know 2:                 #
 Hans, emissary of Æther     #
 Uulaa, emissary of Fire     #
                             #
Its unclear whether this was #
a branch within The Frost    #
Torch's bureaucracy or if it #
was a seperate organisation  #
altogether but it was stated #
on the discord by standard   #
that they did have control   #
over the mines at some point.#

                             #
The Temple of Nagaraja was   #
initially constucted after   #
the Council gained possession#
of the Frost Torch. It was   #
constructed to house the     #
artifact and serve as the    #
capital edifice to the Guild.#
The Guild lost the temple one#
night when the mindstone was #
stolen and hidden within the #
temple and a serpent came    #
upon it and consumed it.     #
The serpent, now empowered by#
the Stone then consumed the  #
Torch and anyone else in the #
vicinity.                    #
The Council, now without     #
control of the mines, nor the#
Temple was disbanded.        #

At the base of the world,    #
light from the sun shines    #
through the world crystal.   #
Like a prism, light was then #
broken into 6 bands, or      #
threads: Cyan, Yellow, Green,#
Blue, Red, and Ki. In the    #
first age, when the world    #
gained conscience it became  #
confused and frightened. It  #
saw the 6 threads coming out #
of itself and tried to remove#
them. Cyan and Yellow were   #
weak and broke off easily.   #
Cyan being the weakest,      #
shattered into the 10 Soul   #
Stones. Green (referred collo#
-quially as the Stream of the#
Silent) was strong and the   #
world wasn't able to pull it #

 want a fast weapon.         #
 Note however that the nest  #

 Many players find Enoki's   #
 peashooter to be quite a    #
 challenge but in this phase #
 they lose their immunity to #
 stun so an effective        #
 strategy is to equip a      #
 compound shield, ideally one#
 with a little bit of stun   #
 duration enchanted on it to #
 interrupt Enoki's attacks.  #

 R.I.Peaces has a weakness to#
 physical which from my tests#
 seems to indicate that it   #
 recieves 7x more damage from#
 physical weapons which is   #
 somewhat helpful considering#
 how the ghosts it summons in#
 front of it are completely  #
 immune to physical...       #

On early levels his arm is   #
able to be unmade after he   #
swings it.                   #
                             #
This also means that if you  #
use a chill staff on him then#
it will appear as though the #
timing on his strike is      #
somewhat random but that's   #
due to the fact that staves  #
only have 50% splash and so  #
your chill stacks will only  #
have a random chance of      #
actually slowing his attack. #
                             #
                             #

 It is possible to dodge his #
 attack with even a well     #
 timed quarterstaff dash. The#
 debuff it applies will      #
 decrease your attack range. #
                             #
 Other than that it's helpful#
 to use splash weapons to    #
 deal with the summoned foes.#

The Bronze Guardian gets a   #
very high shield regeneration#
rate at the higher levels and#
so you're basically required #
to bring a stone potion.     #
The bulk of your damage will #
come from using twin hammers #
when you can so you'll want  #
to maximise your time up     #
close.                       #
That means dodging early and #
dashing in as soon as you can#
                             #
He's immune to chill as well #
so he's much less vulnerable #
to smite damage due to the   #
fact that that removes the   #
majority of the possible     #
number of stacks you can     #
apply to him.                #

 The Ice Wall and the Ice    #
 Pillars are perhaps the foes#

 vulnerable to unmaking so if#

Hrímnir is quite a tricky    #
boss because there's not as  #
many clear options on how to #
fight him.                   #
However on low difficulties  #
it is possible to cheese him.#
If you equip a shovel you're #
able to walk so close to him #
that his snowballs will miss #
                             #
On later difficulties he will#
react by blowing you back if #
you get within 2 range but   #
this can still be exploited  #
because when he does this he #
won't summon an ice wall so  #
if you can first damage him  #
below the 1/3 or 2/3 HP      #
threshold and then walk close#
he will cancel his normal    #
blowback with a non-walling  #
reactionary blowback.        #

Nagaraja's poison stacking   #
will effect which weapons are#
most effective on him. Any   #
weapon that relies on fast   #
low damage attacks will be   #
severely impacted compared to#
slower high damage attacks.  #
                             #
It is possible to dodge a lot#
of the projectiles with good #
dodge scripting but cooldowns#
will still be an issue and   #
you also have to be wary of  #
his stone drop attack which  #
will have a range of 10.     #
                             #
Also be wary if using the BFG#
because if Naga tastes you   #
just as you're on the back-  #
swing then you'll always get #
eaten.                       #

 Dysangelos' first phase is  #
 relatively straightforward  #
 he's vulnerable to fire so  #
 hit him with fire. Short    #
 swords are generally the    #
 best DPS weapons on a single#
 target.                     #
 You can't dodge his giga -  #
 blast in this phase so just #
 kill him before he does it. #

 In this phase he will switch#
 between the elements so you #
 need to have weapons of all #
 types to deal maximal damage#
                             #
 This also has the added     #
 benefit of counteracting his#
 debuffs if you use the      #
 opposing element on him.    #

 Ideally you'll want to dodge#
 both his stun attack and his#
 giga-beam attack however you#
 may have difficulties with  #
 the cooldown on your mind   #
 stone. If you make sure to  #
 stack some chill on him then#
 that'll give your mindstone #
